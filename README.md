# The C Programming Language 2ed Exercises

This repository contains my personal solutions and progress for the exercises found in the classic book, "The C Programming Language, Second Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice and improve my skills in the C programming language. The book covers essential topics such as control structures, functions, pointers, structures, and file I/O, among others. The exercises are designed to help solidify understanding of these concepts and put them into practice.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each chapter has its own directory (e.g., `chapter1`, `chapter2`, etc.).
- Inside each chapter directory, you will find the solutions to the corresponding exercises, named as `exercise1_1.c`, `exercise1_2.c`, etc., where the first number represents the chapter and the second number represents the exercise.

## Usage

To compile and run a solution, navigate to the appropriate directory and use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -o exerciseX_Y exerciseX_Y.c
./exerciseX_Y
```

when using text file as input for the program use the following commands:
```powershell
Get-Content exerciseX_Y.c | exerciseX_Y.exe
```

Replace `X` and `Y` with the respective chapter and exercise numbers.

## Contributions

As this repository serves as my personal journey through "The C Programming Language, Second Edition," I am not accepting contributions. However, feel free to fork the repository or use the solutions for your reference. Keep in mind that these solutions may not be perfect or optimal, as I am also learning along the way.
